 * Write a function:

that, given a positive integer N, 
prints the consecutive numbers from 1 to N,
 each on a separate line. However, any number
 divisible by 2, 3 or 5 should be replaced by 
the word Codility, Test or Coders respectively.
If a number is divisible by more than one of the
numbers: 2,3 or 5, it should be replaced by a 
concatenation of the respective words Codility,
 Test and Coders in this given order. 
For example, numbers divisible by both 2 and 3
should be replac√©e by CodilityTest and numbers
 divisible by all three numbers: 2,3 and 5, 
 should be replaced by CodilityTestCoders.
